This folder contains the Interception driver, which must be installed and working for pighead.exe to run.
To recompile pighead.exe, run ./pighead.gcc. It expects the library to be found in ./intercept-x86/.
For pighead.exe to run correctly, the interception.dll file must be in the same directory as the program.

Use of Interception for commercial purposes is restricted. Check the author's licence for details.
